            I designed and built a small <strong>IoT‑enabled greenhouse</strong> that monitors temperature, humidity, soil
            moisture and light, and automates watering/ventilation. The system logs data for analysis and alerts users
            to abnormal conditions.

            <h3>Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa — 2022-2023</h3>
            <p>
             Spending a semester at Technion in Haifa was one of the most formative experiences of my studies.  
            I joined the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, where I strengthened my technical skills in mechanical design, thermodynamics, and materials science through hands-on projects and laboratory work.  
            Living in a multicultural city — where Jewish, Arab, and international communities coexist — taught me to adapt quickly, communicate across cultures, and appreciate diverse perspectives.  
            Beyond academics, daily life in Israel was a lesson in independence: navigating administrative challenges, discovering unique traditions like Shabbat, and experiencing a completely new rhythm of life.  
            This exchange deeply enhanced my open-mindedness, resilience, and ability to thrive in international and multidisciplinary environments.

            <h3>UIT The Arctic University of Norway? Narvik — 2024</h3>
            <p>
             Immersed in a Nordic approach to <strong>sustainable engineering</strong> that combines technical precision with environmental responsibility.  
            Courses and projects focused on <strong>renewable energy, life-cycle analysis, Lean methods, and Industry 4.0</strong>, fostering a mindset where efficiency and sustainability go hand in hand.  
            Surrounded by the Arctic landscapes of Northern Norway, I learned how nature and engineering coexist — how every design choice must respect resources, endure harsh climates, and remain simple yet durable.  
            This experience deepened my commitment to <strong>eco-design and pragmatic innovation</strong>, where long-term impact matters more than short-term performance.
